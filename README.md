# Stream Stalker

Use the APIs of multiple streaming platforms
and send notifications via lib-notify
to never miss any streams anymore (maybe).

## How to use:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/CarpeNecopinum/StreamStalker.git
    $ cd StreamStalker
    $ npm install
```

- Add the URLs of Streams you want to follow to the `streams` array in the `index.js`.
- Put a Twitch API key into `platforms/secrets/twitch.json` with the key `clientId`

```
    $ npm run
```
